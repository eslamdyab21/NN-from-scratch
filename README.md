# NN-from-scratch
Building Neuron networks from scratch to better understand the ready made libraries and frameworks.

In this repo, a model is created using only NumPy, i.e forward and backward propagation, loss function, and the mechanics of the layers with weights are implemented from scratch.<br>
<br>
`NN.py` contains the implemented classes and are used in the `NN from scratch - mnist digits2.ipynb` notebook in which a model for digits classification is built and trained.
<br>

Then some models are made using tensoreflow in `Tensoreflow` folder.
